                                Survivors of domestic violence often flee abuse with nothing more than the clothes on their backs. Traumatised and fearful, they turn to local domestic violence programs for a shelter from their relentless abuse they faced at the hands of their partner. The shelters provide survivors everything they need to start over from bedding and towels to toothbrushes and shampoo. And they do it for free! And that’s why shelters need your help.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rahmdillik Shelter served over 1000 survivors who found themselves and their families in crisis. The survivors consist of women and children of all ages and ethnic backgrounds who are facing daunting life challenges that inevitably impact their safety, stability, health and all-encompassing well-being. Your support will play a key and distinct role in helping these determined individuals reclaim the necessary attributes which ultimately create a recipe for future successes.

                                Moreover, one of our main goals is to raise awareness about the damages brought to the society by the domestic violence. Raising awareness of the different forms of violence against women and domestic violence is an important element in the prevention of violence against women, because heightened awareness is a first step in changing attitudes and behaviour that perpetuate or condone the various forms of violence against women.
